# Sprint 8 - CRUD Recipes with Map, Calendar, and Charts

## Description

The objective of this sprint was to implement a project using several common plugins that future clients may require in their projects. The data generated by these plugins is stored in a database, and we created an API using Node.js and MySQL. The project includes user registration, login functionality, and provides access to various features upon logging in.

Users can log in with:
- **Email:** `admin@example.com`
- **Password:** `password123`

Alternatively, users can register via the **Register** page.

### User Roles and Access:

- **Guest Users:** Can only view the list of recipes. They **cannot perform** any CRUD actions on the recipes and **do not have access** to the map, charts, or calendar functionalities. 
- **Registered Users:** After logging in, users have full access to all functionalities:
  - Can perform full **CRUD actions** on recipes (create, edit, delete).
  - Can interact with the **map**, **calendar**, and **charts** features, including adding and editing locations and events.

The project covers the following functionalities:
- **CRUD Recipes:** Registered users can create, edit, delete, and view recipes.
- **Map:** Stores and displays locations with latitude and longitude using MapBox, including different categories with a filtering option. Registered users can add new locations and edit existing ones by interacting with the map.
- **FullCalendar:** Allows registered users to add, edit, and delete events.
- **Charts (Chart.js):** Displays three types of charts, including a bar chart, pie chart, and doughnut chart for visualizing recipe categories.

## Project Features

### Recipe Management (CRUD)

- **CRUD Recipes:** Registered users can create, view, edit, and delete recipes in the system. Each recipe includes information such as the recipe name, description, and category.
- **Guest Users:** Can only view the list of recipes but cannot perform CRUD actions.

### Map with Location Markers and Editing Capabilities

- **Location Storage:** Registered users can store a list of locations with latitude, longitude, name, description, and category.
- **Category Filtering:** Includes multiple categories for locations, and users can filter locations based on these categories.
- **Map Integration:** The map is implemented using **MapBox** and shows all stored locations with markers.
- **Double Click to Add Location:** Users can double-click on the map to add a new location with a form that appears for entering name, description, and category.
- **Edit and View Locations:** Double-clicking on any existing location marker opens a details panel where users can edit the location's information. Users can also navigate to a list of locations where editing is possible.
- **Guest Users:** Do not have access to map functionalities.
- **Registered Users:** Have full access to map features, including adding, editing, and filtering locations.

### FullCalendar Events

- **Event Management:** Registered users can view a calendar to which they can add, edit, or delete events.
- **Event API:** The events are stored in a backend API that allows CRUD operations for events on the calendar.
- **Guest Users:** Do not have access to the calendar functionalities.
- **Registered Users:** Can fully interact with the calendar, including adding, editing, and deleting events.

### Charts (Chart.js)

- **Charts Integration:** Displays three types of charts using **Chart.js**:
  - A **bar chart** representing the number of recipes by category (Vegan, Vegetarian, Traditional).
  - A **pie chart** for visualizing the proportion of each category of recipes.
  - A **doughnut chart** showing a visual breakdown of the recipe categories.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, MySQL, Sequelize ORM
- **Frontend:** Angular 18, TypeScript, SCSS, HTML
- **Styling:** Bootstrap with Bootswatch's Solar theme
- **Database Management:** MySQL with phpMyAdmin
- **Map Integration:** MapBox API
- **Charts:** Chart.js
- **Calendar:** FullCalendar Plugin
